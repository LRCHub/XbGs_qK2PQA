[00:01.00] Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
[00:04.69] But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes, six minutes)
[00:09.48] Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
[00:13.00] Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
[00:17.75] If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
[00:21.02] And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
[00:24.57] You are just what the doctor ordered
[00:25.66] I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
[00:28.63] All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
[00:31.87] Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
[00:35.10] They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
[00:37.86] But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
[00:39.92] I got a laptop in my back pocket
[00:41.81] My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
[00:43.46] Got a fat knot from that rap profit
[00:45.02] Made a livin' and a killin' off it
[00:46.28] Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
[00:47.99] With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his -sack
[00:49.82] I'm an MC still as honest
[00:51.15] But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (kill 'em all with)
[00:54.60] This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
[00:56.17] You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
[00:58.12] Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac', backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackity-yack
[01:01.29] And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
[01:04.38] I'll still be able to break a motherf- table
[01:06.19] Over the back of a couple of f- and crack it in half
[01:07.87] Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
[01:11.21] How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
[01:14.30] Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
[01:16.58] It's actually disastrously bad
[01:18.46] For the wack, while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
[01:20.72] 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
[01:24.22] All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
[01:27.00] Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
[01:30.31] Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
[01:33.69] Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
[01:37.05] Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
[01:39.71] Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
[01:41.33] Hit the Earth like an asteroid, did nothin' but shoot for the moon since (pew)
[01:43.86] Mc's get taken to school with this music
[01:45.99] 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
[01:47.78] Now I lead a new school full of students
[01:49.50] Me? I'm a product of Rakim
[01:51.21] Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
[01:55.64] Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
[01:58.87] To meet Run-D.M.C and induct them into the motherf- Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
[02:03.31] Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
[02:05.65] Only hall of fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of (shame)
[02:09.68] You f- think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
[02:12.98] Off a plank and tell me what in the f- are you thinkin'?
[02:15.64] Little g- lookin' boy
[02:16.80] So g- I can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy
[02:19.20] You witnessin' a mass-occur
[02:20.25] Like you're watchin' a church gathering take place lookin' boy
[02:22.60] "Oy vey, that boy's g-", that's all they say, lookin' boy
[02:25.74] You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
[02:27.08] And a "Way-to-go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
[02:28.93] Hey, lookin' boy, what you say, lookin' boy?
[02:30.52] I get a "Hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
[02:32.18] I'ma work for everything I have
[02:33.61] Never asked nobody for sh-, get outta my face, lookin' boy
[02:35.58] Basically boy, you're never gonna be capable
[02:37.25] Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy
[02:38.64] 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
[02:41.94] All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
[02:45.21] The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
[02:48.21] Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
[02:50.94] Kneel before General Zod, this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
[02:54.89] So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
[02:58.12] Let off then I'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
[03:01.42] And I should not be woken
[03:03.14] I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
[03:06.16] But I got your mom deep-
[03:07.93] I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothin' in common, poodle
[03:11.00] I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
[03:14.33] It's me, my honesty's brutal
[03:17.02] But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
[03:20.22] For good at least once in a while
[03:21.44] So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
[03:23.94] Enough rhymes to maybe to try to help get some people through tough times
[03:26.99] But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
[03:30.30] Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
[03:32.71] I know there was a time where once I
[03:34.30] Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
[03:37.75] So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
[03:40.17] Appeal with the skin color of mine
[03:41.67] You get too big, and here they come tryin' to
[03:43.68] Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP One
[03:46.79] When I tried to say, "I'll take seven kids from Columbine
[03:49.57] Put 'em all in a line, add an A-, a revolver and a nine"
[03:53.36] See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
[03:56.72] Morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal
[03:58.82] You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
[04:01.18] And I don't know what the f- that you rhyme for
[04:03.28] You're pointless as Rapunzel with f- cornrows
[04:06.03] You write normal? F- being normal
[04:07.65] And I just bought a new ray-gun from the future
[04:09.88] Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
[04:12.28] 'Cause Fab said he looked like a f- at Mayweather's pad
[04:13.89] Singin' to a man while he played piano
[04:15.42] Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
[04:18.46] So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
[04:21.37] "Hey, Fab, I'ma kill you"
[04:22.61] Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
[04:25.01] Uh, sama lama duma lama, you assumin' I'm a human
[04:26.89] What I gotta do to get it through to you, I'm superhuman?
[04:28.52] Innovative and I'm made of rubber
[04:29.63] So that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you
[04:31.62] I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
[04:32.95] How to give a motherf- audience a feelin' like it's levitating
[04:34.80] Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
[04:36.61] For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
[04:38.17] 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
[04:39.37] I make elevating music, you make elevator music
[04:41.30] Oh, he's too mainstream
[04:42.90] Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
[04:44.92] It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
[04:48.04] With rock, shock rap with Doc
[04:49.94] Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
[04:51.27] I don't know how to make songs like that
[04:52.96] I don't know what words to use
[04:54.51] Let me know when it occurs to you
[04:55.92] While I'm rippin' any one of these verses diverse as you
[04:57.66] It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
[04:59.30] How many verses I gotta murder to
[05:00.91] Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too? Uh
[05:04.72] School flunkie, pill junkie
[05:06.40] But look at the accolades the skills brung me
[05:08.88] Full of myself, but still hungry
[05:10.62] I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
[05:13.78] And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
[05:17.40] But it's still tongue in cheek, f- you
[05:19.01] I'm drunk so Satan take the f- wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
[05:22.08] Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funky
[05:25.15] But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
[05:28.46] Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
[05:32.20] They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women-hate
[05:34.35] But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
[05:36.29] Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
[05:38.95] And understand the discrimination
[05:41.26] But f- it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
[05:44.23] But if I can't batter the women, how the f- am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
[05:47.66] Don't mistake him for (Satan)
[05:48.63] It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
[05:50.90] And take a vacation to trip a broad
[05:52.87] And make her fall on her face and
[05:54.53] Don't be a re-, be a king? Think not
[05:57.17] Why be a king when you can be a God?
