For six minutes, for six minutes, chiga,
for six minutes, for six minutes,
Slim Shady you're on
'chiga-chick, chick-chick on,
chiga-chick chick, on... (repeat)
Verse 1
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
all my people from the front to the back nod,
back nod
now who thinks their arms are long
enough to slap box, slap box
they said I rap like a robot,
so call me rap-bot
but for me to rap like a computer must be
in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when I half-cock it,
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
with Monica Lewinski feelin' on his nutsack,
I'm an MC still as honest
but as rude and indecent as all hell,
syllables skill-a-holic, kill 'em all wit'
this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
you don't really wanna get
into a pissin' match wit' this rappity-rap
packin' a mack in the back of the Ac,
backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack
and at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts,
while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to
break a motha-fuckin' table over the back
of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic,
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
how could I not blow?
All I do is drop "F" bombs,
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period,
here's a Maxi-Pad
it's actually disastrously bad - for the wack
while I'm masterfully constructin'
this master piece (yeah) cuz...
Verse 2
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
all my people from the front to the back nod,
back nod
now who thinks their arms are long
enough to slap box, slap box
let me show you maintainin' this shit
ain't that hard, that hard
everybody want the key and the secret
to rap immortality like I have got
well to be truthful
the blueprint's simply rage
and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance,
hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothin' but shoot for the moon since
(ppeeyoom)
MC's get taken to school wit' this music
'cuz I use it
as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme',
now I lead a New School full of students
me? Me, I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz,
Tupac, N-W-A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella,
Eazy thank you, they got Slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up
and bein' in a position
to meet Run-D.M.C and induct them
into the mothafuckin' Rock 'N
Roll Hall of Fame even tho I'll walk
in the church and burst in a ball of flames,
only hall of fame I'll be inducted
in is the alco-hol of fame,
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game,
'til I walk-a-flock of flames
off a plank and tell me
what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
little gay lookin boy,
so gay I can barely say
it wit a 'straight' face lookin' boy
you're witnessin' a mass-occur like
you're watchin a church gatherin' take place
lookin' boy
oy vey, that boy's gay
that's all they say lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up,
pat on the back and a "way to go"
from your label every day lookin' boy
hey lookin' boy,
what'd ya say lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah!" from Dre lookin' boy
I'm a work for everything
I have never asked nobody for shit,
git out my face lookin' boy
basically boy, you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up wit' the same pace lookin' boy
'cuz...
Verse 3
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
all my people from the front to the back nod,
back nod
the way I'm racin' around the track
call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park,
the White Trash God
kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton,
no Asgard, Asgard
so you be Thor and I'll be Odin,
you rodent, I'm omnipotent
let-off then I'm reloadin' immediately wit
these bombs I'm totin'
and I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead
but I'm just a talkin' head,
a zombie floatin',
but I got your mom deep throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle,
we have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
and pay homage pupil
it's me my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile,
if I don't utilize what I do though
for good at least once in a while,
so I wanna make sure somewhere
in this chicken scratch, I scribble and doodle
enough rhymes ta maybe
try to help git some people through tuff times
but I gotta keep a few punch lines just in case
'cuz even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin'
at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a, time where once I
was king of the underground,
but I still rap like
I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
so I crunch rhymes, but sometimes,
when you combine
appeal wit' the skin color of mine,
you git too big and here they come tryin'
ta censor you like that one line,
I said on 'I'm Back" from the Mathers LP one
when I tried to say
I'll take seven kids from Columbine
put 'em all in a line add an AK-47,
a revolver and a nine
see if I git away wit' it now that
I ain't as big as I was but I'm
morphin' into an immortal,
comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
and I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme
for you're pointless as Rapunzel,
wit' fuckin' cornrows
you write normal, fuck bein' normal
and I just bought a new ray gun
from the future just to come
and shoot ya like when Fabulous made Ray J. mad
'cuz Fab said he looked like a fag,
at Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
while he play piano
man-o-man, that was the 24-7 special
on the cable channel
so Ray J. went straight to radio station
the very next day, "hey Fab
I'ma kill you!" lyrics comin'
at you at supersonic speed (JJ Fad)
uh-summa lumma dooma lumma you assumin'
I'm a human,
what I gotta do to get it through to you,
I'm superhuman
innovative and I'm made of rubber
so that anything you say,
is ricochet'in' off'a me
and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating more that ever demonstrating
how to give a mothafuckin' audience,
a feeling like it's levitating
never fading,
and I know the haters are forever waiting,
for the day that they can say
I fell off they'll be celebrating
'cuz I know the way ta get 'em motivated,
I make elevating music you make elevator music
"oh he's too mainstream" well that's
what they do when they get jealous,
they confuse it
"it's not hip-hop, it's pop"
'cuz I found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock-rap wit Doc,
throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that,
I don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you,
while I'm rippin' any one of these verses,
that vs. you
it's curtains,
I'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses
I gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice,
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
unghh, school flunky, pill junky
but look at the accolades
these skills brung me,
full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself,
cuz I make me do what I put my mind to
and I'm a million leagues above you
ill when I speak in tongues,
but it's still tongue-and-cheek fuck you
I'm drunk, so Satan take the fucking
wheel I'm asleep in the front seat
bumping Heavy D. & the Boyz "still chunky
but funky"
but, in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight wit' devils
and here's what the want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate
some of the woman hate, but if you take
into consideration the bitter hatred
I have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it,
life's handin' you lemons-make lemonade, then
but if I can't batter the women,
how the fuck am I 'sposed
to bake 'em a cake then?
don't mistake him for Satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think
I need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip-a-broad
and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard, be a king? Think not?
why be a King, when you can be a God?
